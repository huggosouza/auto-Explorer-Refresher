# auto-Explorer-Refresher
A simple script made in Python that kills and start again the explorer.exe process when it is using more than 45% of available RAM.

Recommend you to compile it using: pyinstaller --onefile --uac-admin --name autoWinRefresher main.pyw (You'll need to install pyinstaller with pip before it, obviously.)

All the dependencies are "auto-installable".
